# project-euler-solutions
My solutions/workbook for Project Eueler. I'm choosing to do it in C++. because using the language is such a dopamine hit for me--[sorry](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sorry) not sorry. 
If you are not familiar with [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), go check it out. It's like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) but for math problems that are designed to be computed with code. If you aren't familiar with LeetCode, that's okay--it's just coding challenge problems that increase in difficulty. 

### This is Spoilers!
If you plan on participating in Project Euler yourself, don't view these solutions!
